    <h1> Taiwan Easterling</h1>
    <p>This is my about me page. Welcome, everyone</p>
    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I am originally from Mississippi. I grew up in town right outside of Jackson, Mississippi. You could past the place if you blinked. I was a two sport student athlete, where I went on to play collegiate football at <b><i>Florida State University</i></b> and  graduated from college and decided to pursue professional baseball. Injuries derailed my professional career, in which lead me to pursue my Masters degree at <b><i>Northwestern University</i></b>. I'm currently working with a fellowship through an organization, Greater Foundation. My role with the company is Project Managmenent. I really enjoy the work that we are doing and look forward to continue to impact the next generation of leaders.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Florida State University, Northwestern University</p>
    <h2>What sparked my interest in Programming</h2>
    <p> My interest in programming came from when I was in college. While at FSU, the football program introduced me to analytics. Jimbo fisher which is the head football at the Florida State University hired a rocket scientist named Chris Jacobs. Chris implemented GPS systems which tracked every movement a player would make in practice and the weight rooom. The data sets that were created from the gps systems cut down on injuries significantly and the data was able to give the coaches a proven formula that enabled them to hold players out of practice because of fatigue.
